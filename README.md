# What is this project?
Essentially this is a lightweight local (intially at the time of writing this at least) scripting program with a gui that helps real estate brokers, calculate listing transactions, team splits, cap splits and possibly more (In the future). You can input the address, listing price sold, closing date and listing price. After all the input it is calculated using basic python logic and then saved to a database created locally on your machine with SQLite. Cool stuff.

# How it's made
**Tech used:** Python

Used the Tkinter library or ttk? Idk the difference tbh. Also used SQLite3 module which has built in support for python, but it's a file-based dbms system. So whatever that means lol.

# Conclusion
This project is nothing crazy, I just needed to start making stuff. So hopefully my README files in the future are more interesting and more polished.
